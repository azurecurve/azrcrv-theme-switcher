# Description

Allows users to easily switch themes (ideal for allowing light/dark mode).

Theme switcher functionality is made available to users via a widget; settings done via widget administration.

Settings available to display available themes as a list or select drop-down; widget admin allows themes with certain prefix to be excluded and/or to include only themes containing a certain word or part of a word.

As an alternative to using the widget, the function azc_ts_theme_switcher() can be called directly; add 'dropdown' as a parameter to have the select drop-down, instead of the list, of themes returned.

This plugin is multisite compatible; each site will place and configure the Theme Switcher widget.
